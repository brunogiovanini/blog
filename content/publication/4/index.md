abstract: 'The purpose of this study was to investigate the pre-conditioning effects of photobiomodulation on repeated sprint ability of professional basketball players. Ten professional basketball players took part in this randomized, double-blind, placebocontrolled, crossover study. The participants attended two repeated sprint test sessions. In each session, the participants performed a general warm-up followed by a familiarization sprint. Afterward, the participants received either the photobiomodulation (660 and 850nm, 12 J/cm², 83.4 J per point, 10 points, LED treatment) or placebo intervention, and performed the repeated sprint test. The repeated sprint test consisted of ten 30 m sprints with one change of direction (15 + 15 m), interspersed by 30 seconds of passive recovery. Sprint times and heart rate responses were monitored during the test. To compare moments and conditions, linear mixed-effects models were applied with statistical significance set at p < 0.05, and Cohen’s d was used as effect size (ES). The LED treatment could not improve total time (p = 0.662; ES = -0.06), best time (p = 0.869; ES = 0.02), fatigue index (p = 0.169; ES = 0.64), or sprint decrement (p = 0.124; ES = -0.75) when compared to the placebo condition. Additionally, mean heart rate (p = 0.687; ES = 0.07) and maximal heart rate (p = 0.837; ES = -0.03) were similar between conditions. We concluded that the LED condition could not improve the repeated sprint ability of professional basketball players.'
